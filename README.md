This map pack is dedicated to all Nomegatron map enthusiasts, offering them the chance to test their battle prowess across 10+ completely distinct map settings (suitable for both 4v4 and 5v5 matches).
I retained the name 'Nomegatron' as a tribute to Nomega, the original creator of the classic 'Heavy Metal Gauntlet' and 'Drained Nomegatron' systems.
Here, you'll find unique remakes of Nomegatron maps, each featuring different biome from the base game, all polished to 102% perfection and eSports ready!
